# ML Discussions

ML Weekly Discussion is an initiative by COPS to foster the culture of Machine Learning in the college. Once every two weeks we present and discuss an interesting paper from any of the several fields of Machine Learning. This repository consists of presentations and the future talks that will be held. You can find the plan and the rules for the talk [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBZINGhNfpMWj0OuMwPbpLKHH1NL_PM2WibbKfmADPA/edit?usp=sharing)

Information regarding the timing and the mode of the meet will be shared in the whats app group prior to the talk. 

### Steps to follow if you want to give a talk:

- Fill up your name and the topic in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EchoPKgD8OGT7zCAgT_Jo5TKiInWm2O9hZildyiRDW8/edit?usp=sharing)
- Update the "Talks" table below (Make a PR)
- After your talk is done upload your presentation to the ppt folder through a PR (keep in mind the name: Talk[x], where [x] is the talk number)
- Make sure your talk is decided at least a week before its presentation
